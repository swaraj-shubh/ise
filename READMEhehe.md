## 📊 Features Deep Dive

### Search Algorithm

The search system uses PostgreSQL's advanced full-text search capabilities:

- **Weighted Vectors**: Project titles receive higher weight (A) than guide names (B)
- **Ranking**: Results sorted by relevance score using ts_rank
- **Multi-table**: Searches across all academic years simultaneously
- **Performance**: GIN indexes ensure sub-second search times

### Data Processing

The Excel import system features:

- **Intelligent Column Mapping**: Automatically detects column headers
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles merged cells, empty rows, and inconsistent formatting
- **Validation**: Ensures data integrity before database insertion
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently processes large datasets

### Error Handling

- **Graceful Degradation**: Missing columns in older tables don't break functionality
- **Transaction Safety**: Database operations are atomic and rollback on errors
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages and success notifications

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Database Configuration
ASYNC_DB_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://user:password@host:port/database
SYNC_DB_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database

# Admin Credentials
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
```

### Database Schema

The system automatically creates and manages database tables for each academic year, with full-text search vectors and optimized indexes.
